Lonely Pong
===========

About
-----
Lonely Pong is a game to give me some very introductory experience to 
coding for the NES. If Pong was like playing ping pong, Lonely Pong is 
like hitting the ball against the wall over and over. 

Tools
-----
Lonely Pong can be built with NESASM

The very base of this game came from Roth's 
[Nerdy Nights](http://nintendoage.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=22&threadid=7155) tutorials.
